		<H1>Blue whales</H1> 
		<pre>
Blue whales have long been the object of mankind's curiosity and fascination, causing in us a sense of awe and wonder. 
These massive creatures are capable of growing to up to 98 feet long and 190 tons in weight. 
This, by far, makes them the most massive creatures ever known to exist on the earth. 
This sense of wonder, though, hasn't always been the endearing relationship that leads us to revere these creatures. 
In the 1800 and 1900s, because of a dramatic increase in maritime transportation and technologies,
whaling became a new and lucrative source of revenue for sailors. 
These sailors quickly realized that the most profitable practice was to catch and kill the biggest of the whales. 
You can think of it like buying in bulk – the more you get at once the cheaper for you; so it was for the sailors. 
If they could catch one whale the size of two or three small whales, they would save time and money. 
As fate would have it, this practice hit blue whales the hardest. 
Undenounced to the sailors and consumers of the time, this practice was killing away the silent giants of the sea.	
Below are two tables that show the numbers behind this phenomenon….

As you can see, whaling reduced the Blue Whale population by 98.86% in the southern hemisphere.
This extreme reduction in blue whale population lead to an emergency conservation response that emereged in the late 20th century. 
Today, the affects of this conservation movement are being enjoyed by all the world as we are seeing the blue whale population reaching
stable population levels all across the oceans of our planet. 
Videos like the one below are only possible because people stepped up and decided to protect this world's 
biggest creature.

And as you watch, be reminded of why the Blue Whale represents the very best nature has to offer and why this wild beast
is worth protecting.
